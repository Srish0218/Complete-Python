    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is a simple yet effective algorithm that is particularly well-suited for text classification and spam filtering. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice and can be computationally efficient. The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes is that features are conditionally independent given the class, which simplifies the probability calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bayes' Theorem:**\n",
    "   - Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. In the context of classification, it is expressed as:\n",
    "     \\[ P(y \\mid X) = \\frac{P(X \\mid y) \\cdot P(y)}{P(X)} \\]\n",
    "   - Where:\n",
    "     - \\( P(y \\mid X) \\) is the posterior probability of class \\( y \\) given features \\( X \\).\n",
    "     - \\( P(X \\mid y) \\) is the likelihood of features \\( X \\) given class \\( y \\).\n",
    "     - \\( P(y) \\) is the prior probability of class \\( y \\).\n",
    "     - \\( P(X) \\) is the probability of features \\( X \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naive Assumption:**\n",
    "   - The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes is that features are conditionally independent given the class. While this assumption may not hold in reality, the algorithm often performs well in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Types of Naive Bayes:**\n",
    "   - **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** Assumes that continuous features follow a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "   - **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** Used for discrete data, often for text classification with word counts.\n",
    "   - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** Suitable for binary data, where features are either present or absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in Naive Bayes Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Convert the dataset into a format suitable for Naive Bayes, often using term frequency or binary encoding for text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training:**\n",
    "   - Estimate the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem based on the training dataset.\n",
    "     - \\( P(y) \\): Prior probability of each class.\n",
    "     - \\( P(X \\mid y) \\): Likelihood of features given the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prediction:**\n",
    "   - For a new instance with features \\( X \\), calculate the posterior probability \\( P(y \\mid X) \\) for each class and predict the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",

    "What is Naive Bayes classifiers?\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other. To start with, let us consider a dataset.\n",

    "One of the most simple and effective classification algorithms, the Naïve Bayes classifier aids in the rapid development of machine learning models with rapid prediction capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is called Naive Bayes?\n",
    "The “Naive” part of the name indicates the simplifying assumption made by the Naïve Bayes classifier. The classifier assumes that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label. The “Bayes” part of the name refers to Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian who formulated Bayes’ theorem.\n",

    "The dataset is divided into two parts, namely, feature matrix and the response vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature matrix contains all the vectors(rows) of dataset in which each vector consists of the value of dependent features. In above dataset, features are ‘Outlook’, ‘Temperature’, ‘Humidity’ and ‘Windy’.\n",
    "Response vector contains the value of class variable(prediction or output) for each row of feature matrix. In above dataset, the class variable name is ‘Play golf’.\n",
    "Assumption of Naive Bayes\n",
    "The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature independence: The features of the data are conditionally independent of each other, given the class label.\n",
    "Continuous features are normally distributed: If a feature is continuous, then it is assumed to be normally distributed within each class.\n",
    "Discrete features have multinomial distributions: If a feature is discrete, then it is assumed to have a multinomial distribution within each class.\n",
    "Features are equally important: All features are assumed to contribute equally to the prediction of the class label.\n",
    "No missing data: The data should not contain any missing values.\n",
    "With relation to our dataset, this concept can be understood as:\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that no pair of features are dependent. For example, the temperature being ‘Hot’ has nothing to do with the humidity or the outlook being ‘Rainy’ has no effect on the winds. Hence, the features are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "Secondly, each feature is given the same weight(or importance). For example, knowing only temperature and humidity alone can’t predict the outcome accurately. None of the attributes is irrelevant and assumed to be contributing equally to the outcome.\n",
    "The assumptions made by Naive Bayes are not generally correct in real-world situations. In-fact, the independence assumption is never correct but often works well in practice.Now, before moving to the formula for Naive Bayes, it is important to know about Bayes’ theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Bayes’ theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    " P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}              \n",
    "\n",
    "where A and B are events and P(B) ≠ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we are trying to find probability of event A, given the event B is true. Event B is also termed as evidence.\n",
    "P(A) is the priori of A (the prior probability, i.e. Probability of event before evidence is seen). The evidence is an attribute value of an unknown instance(here, it is event B).\n",
    "P(B) is Marginal Probability: Probability of Evidence.\n",
    "P(A|B) is a posteriori probability of B, i.e. probability of event after evidence is seen.\n",
    "P(B|A) is Likelihood probability i.e the likelihood that a hypothesis will come true based on the evidence.\n",
    "Now, with regards to our dataset, we can apply Bayes’ theorem in following way:\n",
    "\n",
    " P(y|X) = \\frac{P(X|y) P(y)}{P(X)}              \n",
    "\n",
    "where, y is class variable and X is a dependent feature vector (of size n) where:\n",
    "\n",
    " X = (x_1,x_2,x_3,.....,x_n)              \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to clear, an example of a feature vector and corresponding class variable can be: (refer 1st row of dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "X = (Rainy, Hot, High, False)\n",
    "y = No\n",
    "So basically, P(y|X)          here means, the probability of “Not playing golf” given that the weather conditions are “Rainy outlook”, “Temperature is hot”, “high humidity” and “no wind”.\n",
    "\n",
    "With relation to our dataset, this concept can be understood as:\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that no pair of features are dependent. For example, the temperature being ‘Hot’ has nothing to do with the humidity or the outlook being ‘Rainy’ has no effect on the winds. Hence, the features are assumed to be independent.\n",
    "Secondly, each feature is given the same weight(or importance). For example, knowing only temperature and humidity alone can’t predict the outcome accurately. None of the attributes is irrelevant and assumed to be contributing equally to the outcome.\n",
    "Now, its time to put a naive assumption to the Bayes’ theorem, which is, independence among the features. So now, we split evidence into the independent parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if any two events A and B are independent, then,\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)\n",
    "Hence, we reach to the result:\n",
    "\n",
    " P(y|x_1,...,x_n) = \\frac{ P(x_1|y)P(x_2|y)...P(x_n|y)P(y)}{P(x_1)P(x_2)...P(x_n)}          \n",
    "\n",
    "which can be expressed as:\n",

    " P(y|x_1,...,x_n) = \\frac{P(y)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i|y)}{P(x_1)P(x_2)...P(x_n)}          \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as the denominator remains constant for a given input, we can remove that term:\n",
    "\n",
    " P(y|x_1,...,x_n)\\propto P(y)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i|y)          \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to create a classifier model. For this, we find the probability of given set of inputs for all possible values of the class variable y and pick up the output with maximum probability. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = argmax_{y} P(y)\\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_i|y)          \n",
    "\n",
    "So, finally, we are left with the task of calculating  P(y)          and P(x_i | y)         .\n",

    "Please note that P(y)          is also called class probability and P(x_i | y)          is called conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different naive Bayes classifiers differ mainly by the assumptions they make regarding the distribution of P(x_i | y).         \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to apply the above formula manually on our weather dataset. For this, we need to do some precomputations on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find P(x_i | y_j)          for each x_i          in X andy_j          in y. All these calculations have been demonstrated in the tables below:\n",

    "naive-bayes-classification\n",

    "\n",
    "Also, we need to find class probabilities P(y)          which has been calculated in the table 5. For example, P(play golf = Yes) = 9/14.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, we are done with our pre-computations and the classifier is ready!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us test it on a new set of features (let us call it today):\n",

    "\n",
    "Since, P(today) is common in both probabilities, we can ignore P(today) and find proportional probabilities as:\n",

    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes\n",
    "In the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent booleans (binary variables) describing inputs. Like the multinomial model, this model is popular for document classification tasks, where binary term occurrence(i.e. a word occurs in a document or not) features are used rather than term frequencies(i.e. frequency of a word in the document).\n",

    "Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "Easy to implement and computationally efficient.\n",
    "Effective in cases with a large number of features.\n",
    "Performs well even with limited training data.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "Assumes that features are independent, which may not always hold in real-world data.\n",
    "Can be influenced by irrelevant attributes.\n",
    "May assign zero probability to unseen events, leading to poor generalization.\n",
    "Applications of Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "Spam Email Filtering: Classifies emails as spam or non-spam based on features.\n",
    "Text Classification: Used in sentiment analysis, document categorization, and topic classification.\n",
    "Medical Diagnosis: Helps in predicting the likelihood of a disease based on symptoms.\n",

    "Weather Prediction: Classifies weather conditions based on various factors.\n",
    "As we reach to the end of this article, here are some important points to ponder upon:\n",
    "\n",
    "In spite of their apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many real-world situations, famously document classification and spam filtering. They require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary parameters.\n",
    "Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods. The decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one dimensional distribution. This in turn helps to alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, Naive Bayes classifiers, despite their simplified assumptions, prove effective in various applications, showcasing notable performance in document classification and spam filtering. Their efficiency, speed, and ability to work with limited data make them valuable in real-world scenarios, compensating for their naive independence assumption\n"
