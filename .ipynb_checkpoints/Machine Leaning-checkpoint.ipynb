    "5. Neural Networks (with a binary output layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Multiclass classification, also known as multinomial classification, is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to assign input instances to one of three or more classes or categories. Each instance can belong to only one class, and the output is a single class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "1. Handwritten Digit Recognition: Classifying digits (0-9) based on images.\n",
    "2. Species Classification: Identifying the species of a plant or animal from a set of possible categories.\n",
    "3. Language Identification: Determining the language of a given text from multiple language options.\n",

    "2. Support Vector Machines (with extensions)\n",
    "3. Decision Trees and Random Forests\n",
    "4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "5. Naive Bayes\n",
    "6. Neural Networks (with a softmax output layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Classes:**\n",
    "   - Binary classification has two classes (positive/negative, spam/non-spam), while multiclass classification has three or more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Layer in Neural Networks:**\n",
    "   - In neural networks designed for binary classification, the output layer typically has one neuron with a sigmoid activation function. For multiclass classification, the output layer has multiple neurons with a softmax activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "   - For binary classification, metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. In multiclass classification, these metrics are often extended or computed separately for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Algorithms Handling Multiclass:**\n",
    "   - Some algorithms (like logistic regression and support vector machines) can be extended naturally for multiclass classification, while others may require modifications or the use of specific strategies (one-vs-all, one-vs-one).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both binary and multiclass classification are widely used in various applications, and the choice between them depends on the nature of the problem and the number of distinct classes involved."
